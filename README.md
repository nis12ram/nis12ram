# Hi there, I'm nishant! 👋

🎓 **Student | Aspiring Data Engineer**

I’m currently a student focused on becoming a Data Engineer, with hands-on experience in building reliable data workflows and scalable pipelines. I’m especially interested in:

***Designing efficient ETL/ELT pipelines***

***Scalable data processing with Spark / PySpark***

***Reliable data partitioning, backfills, and incremental processing***

🔬 **What I'm Using**

**Azure Data Factory**: For building and orchestrating data pipelines

**SQL**: Almost everywhere

**Python**: For data transformation task & occasional automation

**PySpark**: For data processing and transformations


🌱 **What I'm Focusing**

I’m learning Azure Data Engineering concepts — thinking about Azure Data Factory, Data Lake, Synapse & Databricks for building end-to-end pipelines.

Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline for AgriBridge Commodities Limited to ingest and process daily agricultural price data. The pipeline identifies in-state commodity price arbitrage opportunities (price differences for the same item within the same state) to generate actionable profit insights for the trading team.

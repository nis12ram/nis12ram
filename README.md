***Reliable data partitioning, backfills, and incremental processing***

ðŸ”¬ **What I'm Learning & Using**

**Python**: My primary programming language

**SQL**: Data modeling & querying large datasets

**PySpark**: Distributed data processing and transformations

ðŸŒ± **Current Focus**
Iâ€™m learning Azure Data Engineering concepts â€” thinking about Azure Data Factory, Data Lake, Synapse & Databricks for building end-to-end pipelines.
